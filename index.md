## The Core Insight

Kyle Allen proposed that ancient stoneworkers used **high-frequency vibration with abrasive medium** to grind stones into polygonal fit. This repository documents peer-reviewed physics research that supports this hypothesis.

### The Physics Is Published

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **89% friction reduction** via ultrasonic vibration | Luo et al. 2024, *Scientific Reports* | Stone transport becomes feasible |
| **Piezoelectric quartz weakening** at resonant frequencies | Saksala et al. 2023, *Rock Mechanics* | Explains faster drilling through harder quartz |
| **Self-organizing contact mechanics** | Tribology literature | Surfaces naturally converge to maximum contact |

### One Technology, Four Applications

1. **Fitting**: Two stones vibrating with abrasive → self-correcting polygonal fit
2. **Transport**: Vibration against ground → 89% friction drop → stone "walks"
3. **Drilling**: Ultrasonic tube with abrasive → quartz resonates sympathetically
4. **Nubs**: Anchor points preventing device from walking off during processing

## Key Evidence

### Chris Dunn's Anomaly

From the Petrie Museum drill cores:

> *"The spiral groove cut deeper through the quartz than through the softer feldspar. In conventional machining the reverse would be the case."*

**This is backwards.** Harder material should cut slower. Unless the quartz is resonating sympathetically with ultrasonic vibration—then it shakes itself apart faster than inert feldspar.

### The Nub Distribution

- Concentrated on **lower courses** (processed first, closest to bedrock)
- Often **too small for rigging**
- Left on "finished" surfaces
- Pattern suggests **functional anchor points**, not lifting handles
