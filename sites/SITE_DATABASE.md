## Data Collection Priorities

For each site, we need:

1. **Acoustic measurements**
   - Chamber resonant frequencies
   - Impulse response recordings
   - Frequency response of stone materials

2. **Nub documentation**
   - Location on each stone
   - Course height correlation
   - Size consistency
   - Wear patterns / surface finish

3. **Joint geometry**
   - Any accessible interior joint surfaces
   - Directional changes in fitted faces
   - Pillowing depth and distribution

4. **Rut analysis** (where applicable)
   - Width variation along length
   - Wear pattern type (abrasive vs. rolling)
   - Gradient and direction
   - Relationship to quarries/sites

5. **Material analysis**
   - Piezoelectric properties
   - Stress patterns
   - Surface micro-structure
