# Acoustic Properties of Stone Materials

## Relevant Material Science for Resonance Architecture Hypothesis

---

## Granite

### Basic Properties
- **Density**: 2650-2750 kg/m³
- **Compressive strength**: 100-250 MPa
- **Speed of sound**: ~5500-6000 m/s (varies with composition)
- **Acoustic impedance**: High (good for resonant structures)

### Piezoelectric Properties
Granite contains **quartz** (typically 20-60% by volume), which is strongly piezoelectric.

**Implications**:
- Mechanical stress → electrical charge
- Electrical field → mechanical strain
- Vibrating granite generates electrical effects
- Sustained vibration could produce measurable EM fields

**Research needed**: 
- Has anyone measured EM emissions from vibrating granite blocks?
- Do specific granite types (higher quartz content) show stronger effects?

### Acoustic Behavior
- Excellent sound transmission
- Low internal damping (rings like a bell when struck)
- Can sustain resonance for extended periods
- Frequency response depends on geometry

## Limestone

### Basic Properties
- **Density**: 2300-2700 kg/m³
- **Compressive strength**: 15-100 MPa (highly variable)
- **Speed of sound**: ~3500-4500 m/s
- **Acoustic impedance**: Moderate

### Piezoelectric Properties
Limestone (calcium carbonate) is **not piezoelectric**.

However:
- Often contains quartz inclusions
- Some forms have fossils with silica content
- Acoustic properties still relevant for resonant cavities

### Acoustic Behavior
- Softer than granite, more internal damping
- Good for acoustic shaping (easier to carve precise chambers)
- Absorbs some frequencies (natural acoustic treatment)
- Porous varieties may have different properties

**Note**: Many sites use limestone for chambers but granite for key elements (King's Chamber, Osirion blocks). Deliberate material selection?

## Andesite

### Basic Properties
- **Density**: 2500-2800 kg/m³  
- **Compressive strength**: 100-300 MPa
- **Speed of sound**: ~5000-5500 m/s
- **Acoustic impedance**: High

### Piezoelectric Properties
Contains **feldspars** and sometimes quartz. Some piezoelectric potential.

### Acoustic Behavior
- Similar to granite (volcanic origin)
- Very hard, holds precision well
- Rings when struck
- Primary material at Peruvian sites (Ollantaytambo, Sacsayhuamán upper courses)

## Basalt

### Basic Properties
- **Density**: 2800-3000 kg/m³
- **Compressive strength**: 100-300 MPa
- **Speed of sound**: ~5500-6500 m/s
- **Acoustic impedance**: Very high

### Piezoelectric Properties
Contains feldspars, some quartz. Moderate piezoelectric potential.

### Acoustic Behavior
- Very dense, excellent sound transmission
- Used in some Egyptian contexts
- High-quality bell-like resonance

## Sandstone

### Basic Properties
- **Density**: 2000-2600 kg/m³
- **Compressive strength**: 20-170 MPa
- **Speed of sound**: ~2500-4000 m/s
- **Acoustic impedance**: Moderate to low

### Piezoelectric Properties
**High quartz content** (often 90%+). Strong piezoelectric potential.

### Acoustic Behavior
- More porous, higher damping than granite
- But quartz content may be more important than acoustic ringing

**Note**: Red sandstone at Puma Punku. Deliberate selection for piezoelectric properties?

## Water as Acoustic Coupling Medium

### Properties
- **Density**: 1000 kg/m³
- **Speed of sound**: ~1500 m/s
- **Acoustic impedance**: Matched to human tissue

### Relevance to Resonance Architecture
- Excellent transmission of vibration
- Couples air (human vocalization) to stone more efficiently
- Fills gaps, creates continuous acoustic path
- Flooding of Osirion, Zawyet el-Aryan basin — functional?

### Piezoelectric Effect in Water
Water itself isn't piezoelectric, but:
- Can carry charge
- Enables electrochemical effects
- May enhance piezoelectric output from stone

## Resonant Frequency Calculations

For a rectangular chamber:
```
f = (c/2) × √[(n/L)² + (m/W)² + (p/H)²]
```
Where:
- f = resonant frequency
- c = speed of sound (~343 m/s in air)
- L, W, H = length, width, height
- n, m, p = mode numbers (integers)

### Example: King's Chamber
- Dimensions: ~10.5m × 5.2m × 5.8m
- Fundamental modes would be in the 16-33 Hz range
- Just below human hearing but **felt** as vibration
- Matches infrasound range associated with altered states

### Example: Hypogeum Oracle Chamber
- Documented resonance at ~110 Hz
- Male vocal range fundamental
- Amplification of chanting would be dramatic

## Ultrasonic Considerations

Standard ultrasonic machining: 20-40 kHz

**Question**: Could lower frequencies (audible range) achieve similar effects at larger scales?

Consider:
- Higher amplitude at lower frequency
- Larger contact areas
- Sustained application over longer time
- Combined with abrasive medium (sand, water)

The mechanism may not require "ultrasonic" frequencies — it may require **sufficient amplitude** at **any** frequency that induces differential motion at the contact surface.

---

## Research Priorities

1. **Measure resonant frequencies** of key chambers (King's Chamber, Hypogeum, Osirion)

2. **Test piezoelectric output** of granite blocks under sustained acoustic excitation

3. **Analyze surface micro-structure** of pillowed faces for abrasion signatures

4. **Model frequency requirements** for stone-on-stone abrasion at different scales

5. **Test friction reduction** of stone on stone under vibration (laboratory scale)
