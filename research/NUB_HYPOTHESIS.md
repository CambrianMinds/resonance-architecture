# The Nub Hypothesis

## Bosses/Protrusions on Megalithic Stones: Function Analysis

---

## Conventional Explanation

The standard archaeological interpretation is that nubs (bosses, protrusions) were:
- Lifting handles for ropes during construction
- Attachment points for wooden levers
- Left on "unfinished" stones

---

## Problems with Conventional View

1. **Size inconsistency with function**
   - Many nubs are too small for effective rope attachment
   - Same size nubs appear on 10-ton and 100-ton blocks
   - If for lifting, size should scale with stone mass

2. **Placement issues**
   - Often positioned where they'd be useless for lifting
   - Some are in recessed or inaccessible positions
   - Not consistently at center of mass

3. **Left on "finished" walls**
   - If purely construction aids, why not remove them?
   - The pillowed faces are clearly finished work
   - Nubs remain on otherwise complete surfaces

4. **Distribution pattern**
   - Concentrated on lower courses
   - Upper courses often lack nubs entirely
   - This is opposite of what lifting would require (more complex rigging higher up)

## Proposed Function: Vibration Tool Anchors

### The Problem the Nubs Solve

If you press a vibrating tool against a stone surface:
- The tool tends to "walk" across the surface
- High-frequency vibration causes loss of friction grip
- You need something to hook onto

### The Solution

Nubs provide **anchor points** for vibrational devices:
- Tool clamps onto or wraps around nub
- Maintains contact during operation
- Transfers vibration into stone body

### Why Lower Courses Have More Nubs

1. **Closest to bedrock resonance**
   - Foundation stones sit on vibrating ground
   - Need external tool to control/supplement vibration
   - Nubs provide attachment point

2. **Worked first in sequence**
   - Lower courses fitted before upper courses placed
   - Access to all surfaces during fitting process
   - Nubs accessible during this phase

3. **Heaviest stones**
   - Most critical to fit precisely
   - Require most sustained vibration work
   - Need secure tool attachment

4. **Buried by subsequent courses**
   - Once upper stones placed, nubs inaccessible anyway
   - No functional reason to remove them
   - They're not visible in finished structure (often)

### Why Upper Courses May Lack Nubs

1. **Farther from bedrock**
   - Less ambient vibration from ground coupling
   - But also lighter stones, easier to vibrate

2. **Ambient field may suffice**
   - If site architecture generates standing waves
   - Upper stones may vibrate without direct tool contact
   - Chamber geometry provides the energy

3. **Different technique possible**
   - Smaller stones can be worked by direct contact
   - Handheld tools without anchor points
   - Or different non-vibrational finishing

## Observable Predictions

### Nub Distribution

**Prediction**: Nubs should correlate with:
- Course height (more on lower, fewer on upper)
- Stone mass (more on heavier stones at same height)
- Position in structure (more on foundation, less on capstones)

**Test**: Systematic survey of nub locations across multiple sites

### Nub Wear Patterns

**Prediction**: If nubs were vibration anchors, they should show:
- Surface glazing or polish from friction
- Wear patterns consistent with clamping
- Possible thermal effects from sustained vibration

**Test**: Close examination of nub surfaces, comparison to unused stone surfaces

### Nub Geometry

**Prediction**: If nubs interfaced with a standardized device, they should show:
- Consistent size within a site (fitting same tool)
- Consistent shape (designed for specific attachment method)
- Possible marks from tool contact

**Test**: Measurement of nub dimensions across stones at same site

### Nub Material

**Prediction**: Nubs are same material as stone body (not attached)
- They're remnants of original block
- Not added elements

**Test**: Material continuity analysis (already confirmed at most sites)

---

## Counter-Evidence to Consider

### Some nubs appear decorative
- Rare cases where nubs seem part of aesthetic design
- May be later repurposing of functional elements
- Or different tradition

### Some are clearly rope-worn
- Genuine lifting evidence on some stones
- May indicate mixed technology (vibration + conventional rigging)
- Or later reuse of earlier construction

### Nubs on isolated blocks
- Quarry stones with nubs never placed in walls
- Could be quarrying-related
- Or prepared for transport that never happened

## Sites for Nub Analysis

### High Priority
- **Sacsayhuamán** (Peru) — many nubs visible, lower courses
- **Ollantaytambo** (Peru) — nubs on temple blocks
- **Osirion** (Egypt) — granite blocks, check for nubs

### Medium Priority
- **Giza temples** (Egypt) — valley temple, mortuary temples
- **Baalbek** (Lebanon) — trilithon blocks
- **Machu Picchu** (Peru) — various structures

---

## Experimental Proposal

### Laboratory Test

1. Obtain granite block with protrusion
2. Attach vibrating device to protrusion
3. Measure vibration transfer efficiency vs. flat contact
4. Compare wear patterns under sustained operation

### Field Study

1. Document nub distribution at accessible site (Sacsayhuamán)
2. Map nub locations against course height
3. Photograph nub surfaces for wear analysis
4. Correlate with stone mass estimates

## Connection to Transport

If nubs are vibration anchors, they may have served dual purposes:
- Stone fitting at construction site
- Stone transport along resonant pathways

The same attachment point could interface with:
- Fitting tools (precision work)
- Transport mechanisms (movement along ruts)

This would explain why nubs appear on quarry stones as well as placed stones.

---

## Open Questions

1. What did the device attached to the nubs look like?
2. How was vibration generated in the device?
3. Was there a direct acoustic coupling, or mechanical?
4. Did different nub shapes indicate different functions?
5. Were nubs ever deliberately removed? Why or why not?
