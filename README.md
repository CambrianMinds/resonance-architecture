## The Core Insight

Kyle Allen proposed that ancient stoneworkers used **high-frequency vibration with abrasive medium** to grind stones into polygonal fit. This repository documents peer-reviewed physics research that supports this hypothesis.

### The Physics Is Published

| Finding | Source | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **89% friction reduction** via ultrasonic vibration | Luo et al. 2024, *Scientific Reports* | Stone transport becomes feasible |
| **Piezoelectric quartz weakening** at resonant frequencies | Saksala et al. 2023, *Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering* | Explains faster drilling through harder quartz |
| **Self-organizing contact mechanics** | Tribology literature | Surfaces naturally converge to maximum contact |

### One Technology, Four Applications

1. **Fitting**: Two stones vibrating with abrasive → self-correcting polygonal fit
2. **Transport**: Vibration against ground → 89% friction drop → stone "walks"
3. **Drilling**: Ultrasonic tube with abrasive → quartz resonates sympathetically
4. **Nubs**: Anchor points preventing device from walking off during processing

## Key Evidence

### Chris Dunn's Anomaly

From the Petrie Museum drill cores:

> *"The spiral groove cut deeper through the quartz than through the softer feldspar. In conventional machining the reverse would be the case."*

**This is backwards.** Harder material should cut slower. Unless the quartz is resonating sympathetically with ultrasonic vibration—then it shakes itself apart faster than inert feldspar.

### The Nub Distribution

- Concentrated on **lower courses** (processed first, closest to bedrock)
- Often **too small for rigging**
- Left on "finished" surfaces
- Pattern suggests **functional anchor points**, not lifting handles

This research is offered freely to Kyle Allen and the Brothers of the Serpent community. The physics supports the hypothesis. The question is how the ancients generated the frequencies.

*Ideas want to propagate.*
