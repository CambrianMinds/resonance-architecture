- ⬜ Peer review / publication
- ⬜ Detailed photo analysis (Justin's Cusco documentation)

## Priority 1: The Cusco Photo Evidence

### Background
Justin has photographs from Cusco showing shifted wall sections that reveal interior joint geometry. These may represent **critical evidence** that:
- Rules out geopolymer/casting (molds would produce uniform interior)
- Rules out conventional fitting (chiseling would produce flat interior)
- Supports vibrational fitting (shows directional changes in fit surfaces)

### Action Items
1. **Locate and organize** Justin's Cusco photographs
2. **Identify** images showing interior joint geometry
3. **Document** specific features:
   - Direction changes in fitted faces
   - Pillowing continuation into interior
   - Surface texture and character
4. **Create detailed analysis document** with annotated images
5. **Consider** professional photography/documentation if revisit possible

### Why This Is Priority 1
- This is **firsthand evidence** we control
- No one else has documented this specific observation
- Could be definitive for ruling out alternative theories
- Immediately actionable

## Priority 2: Simple Laboratory Experiments

### Friction Reduction Test
**Equipment needed**: Stones, vibration source (speaker), force gauge  
**Estimated cost**: $100-200  
**Time**: 1 weekend

**Protocol**:
1. Measure static friction between two stone surfaces
2. Apply vibration at various frequencies
3. Measure dynamic friction
4. Document relationship

**Expected outcome**: Significant friction reduction under vibration

---

### Surface Fitting Test
**Equipment needed**: Two rough stones, vibration source, abrasive (sand), water  
**Estimated cost**: $150-250  
**Time**: Several weekends (sustained vibration sessions)

**Protocol**:
1. Measure initial contact area (dye transfer)
2. Apply sustained vibration with abrasive slurry
3. Measure contact area at intervals
4. Document surface evolution and pillowing development

**Expected outcome**: Increasing contact area; pillowed appearance develops

---

### Cymatics Demonstration
**Equipment needed**: Speaker, plate, salt/sand  
**Estimated cost**: $50-100  
**Time**: 1 day

**Protocol**:
1. Build simple Chladni plate setup
2. Document patterns at various frequencies
3. Create visual demonstrations of vibration organizing matter

**Expected outcome**: Visual proof of frequency → pattern relationship

## Priority 3: Academic Literature Deep Dive

### Key Papers to Locate and Analyze
1. **Jahn et al. (1996)** - JASA acoustical resonances paper (full text)
2. **Cook et al. (UCLA)** - 110 Hz EEG effects study
3. **Debertolis et al.** - Malta Hypogeum acoustic research
4. **Royal College of Art** - Preseli bluestone acoustic study
5. **Chris Dunn** - Original Egyptian machining analysis

### Goals

- Independent replication of experiments
- Professional acoustic surveys of sites
- Micro-surface analysis of ancient stone

### Dissemination
- Documentary film or video series
- Book or monograph

## Success Criteria

### The hypothesis is **supported** if:
1. Friction is significantly reduced under vibration
2. Surface fitting improves with sustained vibration
3. Nub distribution correlates with course height across sites
4. Interior joint geometry shows directional changes
5. Acoustic properties are consistent with documented resonances
6. Piezoelectric output is measurable from vibrating granite

### The hypothesis is **falsified** if:
1. Vibration does not reduce friction significantly
2. Surface fitting does not improve with vibration
3. Nub distribution is random or correlates with block size only
4. Interior joints show uniform geometry consistent with casting
5. Acoustic properties are inconsistent or unremarkable
6. No piezoelectric output is detectable

### We commit to accepting results either way
Science requires following evidence wherever it leads.
