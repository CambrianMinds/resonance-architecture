## Historical Sources

### 5. Original Drill Core Observations

**Petrie, W.M.F. (1883)**
*The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh*
Field & Tuer, London

*   **URL**: [Available at Giza Archives](http://giza.fas.harvard.edu/library/petrie-pyramids-and-temples-gizeh-1883)

### 6. Modern Analysis of Petrie's Cores

**Dunn, C. (1999)**
*The Giza Power Plant: Technologies of Ancient Egypt*
Bear & Company

*   **Key Observation**: "The spiral groove cut deeper through the quartz than through the softer feldspar. In conventional machining the reverse would be the case."
