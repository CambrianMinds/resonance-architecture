## Archaeoacoustic Studies

### 5. Cook, Pajot & Leuchter (2008) — 110 Hz Brain Activity

**File:** `Cook_2008_Time_Mind_110Hz_Brain_Activity.pdf`

*"Ancient Architectural Acoustic Resonance Patterns and Regional Brain Activity"*  
Time and Mind, 1(1), 95-104

**Authors:** UCLA Laboratory of Brain, Behavior, and Pharmacology

**Key Finding:** At 110 Hz specifically, left temporal (language) brain activity significantly decreased; prefrontal asymmetry shifted to right-hemisphere dominance. This frequency matches resonance in megalithic chambers.

### 6. Debertolis et al. (2015) — Malta Hypogeum Acoustics

**File:** `Debertolis_2015_Malta_Hypogeum_Archaeoacoustics.pdf`

*"Archaeoacoustic Analysis of the Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum in Malta"*  
Journal of Anthropology and Archaeology, 3(1), 59-79

**Key Finding:** The Oracle Room (c. 4000 BC) exhibits dual resonance at 70 Hz and 114 Hz. Male voice at these frequencies stimulates resonance throughout the entire hypogeum structure.

### 7. Debertolis et al. (2017) — Göbekli Tepe Acoustics

**File:** `Debertolis_2017_Gobekli_Tepe_Archaeoacoustics.pdf`

*"Archaeoacoustic Analysis in Enclosure D at Göbekli Tepe in South Anatolia, Turkey"*  
Super Brain Research Group

**Collaboration:** With Klaus Schmidt (site discoverer, deceased 2014)

**Key Finding:** 20-22 Hz underground vibration; central T-pillar resonates at 68-69 Hz with harmonics in the 65-145 Hz range—the exact range shown to affect brain activity. World's oldest known temple (c. 10,000 BC) was built on acoustic phenomena.

## Historical Analysis

### 8. Dunn — Drill Core Observations

**File:** `Dunn_Advanced_Machining_Ancient_Egypt.html`

Christopher Dunn's analysis of Petrie's drill core observations, documenting the anomalous feed rates and the quartz/feldspar paradox.

**Key Finding:** Ancient drill cores show 500x modern feed rates, with harder quartz cutting faster than softer feldspar
